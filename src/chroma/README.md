## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Trying it out

`python main.py` for the most basic smoke test
`python load_yolo3.py` for a more robust test

## .chroma

`.chroma` folders will contain serialized parquet and index files where appropriate.

most users will add `.chroma` to their `.gitignore` and we might want to do that for them.
